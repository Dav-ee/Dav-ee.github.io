<h2 style=" color:indigo; text-decoration:underline;"> To all students who feels like their opionated classmates Know way more than they do.</h2>
<p>
My name is Kiprono Davies(actually i love being called <b> Dav_ee </b> don't ask me why!!)
right now am a student pursuing Computer Science.
 <br>
I love to solve problems, whether its finding the most elegant way to write a line of code or thinking deeper within the base problem. I love the chalenge of  of <i> finding a way within a problem </i>
and discovering solutions. As long as  there's a problem to solve or a challenge to puzzle over,it's bound to something i love!
 <br>
 <br>


If i'am being honest i still feel intimidated sometimes.
As i'm writing this i'm a ** year* student.
now with two new languages under my belt- C and JAVA - On top of once i've worked before- Mainly C++.
While some of my classmates are comparing language pros and cons regularly,i still couldn't tell you of all the nuances,
benefits,or consequences of each language,at least no to the extent others are.
 <br>
  <br>
I realized that though ,that for beginners ,even little details are concepts you are just not familiar with yet.
But hold on that keyword: <i> yet! </i>
 <br>
  <br>
 
One of the things that people find about coding is that at first , it seems like their is a right answer and a wrong answer.
 Your code either worksor it doesn't , and if you find the things that don't work , you fix them and then it does. It's like a 
 puzzle-Thats how i describe it when people ask me <i>  why i love programming </i>
 <br>
  <br>
 But then, one of the things you learn as you progress is that.....there's generally one  "right answer, and there's a bajillion
 ways for it to work and still get it  'wrong', too.
  <br>
   <br>
 Don't let opionated people make you feel like  you're capable of less for not having an opinion.Since knowing more generally 
 results in having more opinnions,people tend to think that having more opinions automatically means they know more;but that's 
 simply not the case.
