 My story </h1>
<p class="about">And Here is my  story...... i (Dav_ee) have had about Four months as a help desk person at a local chamber of commerce, 
this is where I wrote some applications, because I offered to do so (they didn’t have anyone skilled in that area).
I also took on ordering of supplies,creating a database for auditing equipment (again did this becoz of my own interest),
 putting together PCs (i.e. adding network cards, memory, installing software,OS,and 
server management etc) for new starters,and dabbled into a little bit of networking as well. I also taught various courses
 for learning office applications etc - < about thirty employees in the time I was there> .Remember I stayed for 4 months. 
 When I look back on it, this seemed a perfectly reasonable, and reasonably laid-back workload at the time! Then there 
 was a month or two of hell where I tried to be a Project Manager at a small software company and failed dismally.
 I did learn about how sneaky some people can be, and I believe I met my first fully-fledged psychopath. We’ll call 
 that a learning experience, and a mismatch of cultures. I generally left that one out of the conversation if I could.
 I did some temporary work (as I got fired from that job) for a while, and one of the jobs was a help desk person at a 
 large pub retailer. I spent TWo months on help desk, doing application support, shadowing a few network guys to learn
 the ropes, supported pub systems,and helping people out with their Excel Macros. It was a step down, you might say,
 but as soon as the Development teams realized my skills, I was being offered work in about three different areas, 
so I got to choose what I wanted to do - android and web development as i had vast knowledge in JAVA,Javascript,HTML,CSS..<

 What i have realized so far: </h1>
 <p class="about">
 When you are younger, you don’t know where overload level is so much, so you keep taking it on until you find that point. 
 Then you can work out what to reduce so you cope better, but in the process learned the bits that really appeal to you. 
 So as you work those bits out, make sure that when you go to your interviews for another job, you concentrate on the parts 
 that are relevant to that job, but also that you want to learn next. If you have a gap in a particular area, you explain that 
 you have a gap there, but show examples of where you have quickly filled a gap by learning for yourself,
 asking the right people etc. Demonstrate that if you are not a 100% fit for the job, you will be very shortly after you
 join the company. And make sure that they are a fit for what you want to do. Ask questions about how they can help you
 expand your own career development (don’t ask what they are going to give you - ask what opportunities you will have 
 available to grow yourself - they want to know you will guide your own career). Make sure the culture is a good fit for what
 you want. Do you want a traditional ‘climbing the ladder’ career? Well, good luck. Most companies promote from outside these
 days to ensure their company doesn’t stagnate.
